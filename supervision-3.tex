\begin{questions}
  \question Derive the conditions necessary for two Bézier curves to join with:
    \begin{solution}
      Consider two bezier curves $p(t)$ and $q(t)$, defined by control points
      $(p_0,p_1,..., p_n)$ and $(q_0, q_1,..., q_n)$ respectively.
    \end{solution}
  \begin{parts}
    \part just C0-continuity
      \begin{solution}
        $C0$ continuity can be achieved by setting $p(1) = q(0)$ giving:
        \begin{center}
          $q_0 = p_n$
        \end{center}
      \end{solution}
    \part C1-continuity
      \begin{solution}
        $C1$ continuity can be achieved with the additional constraint that
        $p'(1) = q'(0)$ giving:
        \begin{center}
          $q_1 - q_0 = p_n - P_{n-1}$
        \end{center}

        Which when combined with the above constraint gives:
        \begin{center}
          $q_1 = 2p_n - p_{n-1}$
        \end{center}
      \end{solution}
    \part C2-continuity
      \begin{solution}
        For $C2$ continuity we must also have that $p''(1) = q''(0)$, giving:
        \begin{center}
          $q_2 - 2q_1 + q_0 = p_n - 2P_{n-1} + p_{n-2}$
        \end{center}

        Which when combined with the above constraint gives:
        \begin{center}
          $q_2 = p_{n-2} + 4(p_n - p_{n-1})$
        \end{center}
      \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

  \question What would be difficult about getting three Bézier curves to join
    in sequence with C2-continuity at the two joins?
    \begin{solution}

    \end{solution}

  \question
    For a cylinder of radius $2$, with endpoints $(1,2,3)$ and $(2,4,5)$, show
    how to calculate:
    \begin{parts}
      \part an axis-aligned bounding box
        \begin{solution}
          Let $m$, $n$, and $o$ represent the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes
          respectively.

          Let $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints such that $A_M <= B_M$.

          Let $
          \delta =
          \frac{\sqrt{(A_n - B_n)^2 + (A_o - B_o)^2}}
               {(A_m - B_m)^2 + (A_n - B_n)^2 + (A_o - B_o)^2}
          $

          $m_{min} = A_m - \delta \times r$ \\
          $m_{max} = B_m + \delta \times r$


        \end{solution}

      \part a bounding sphere
        \begin{solution}
          % TODO Image here
          The bounding sphere has midpoint that is half way between the two
          endpoints:
          ${mid} = (1.5, 3, 4)$

          The radius is the distance from the midpoint to a point on the edge
          of the cylinder.

          One such point is $(2, 4 + \sqrt{2}, 5 - \sqrt{2})$.

          Giving: $r = \sqrt{(0.5)^2 + (1+\sqrt{2})^2 + (1-\sqrt{2})^2} = 2.5$
        \end{solution}
    \end{parts}

    \question
    Break down the following (2D!) lines into a BSP-tree, splitting them if necessary:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{$(0,0)-(2,2)$}
        \item{$(3,4)-(1,3)$}
        \item{$(1,0)-(-3,1)$}
        \item{$(0,3)-(3,3)$}
        \item{$(2,0)-(2,1)$}
    \end{itemize}

    \question
    \begin{parts}
        \part{Compare the two methods of doing 3D clipping in terms of efficiency}
        \part{How would using bounding volumes improve efficiency of these methods?}
    \end{parts}

    \question
    Describe a complete algorithm to do 3D polygon scan conversion, including details of clipping, projection, and the underlying 2D polygon scan conversion algorithm.

    \question
    Describe how you would form a good approximation to a cylinder from Bézier patches. Draw the patches and their control points and give the coordinates of the control points.

    \question
    Given the following sixteen points, calculate the first eight of the next patch joining it as $t$ increases so that the join has continuity $C1$. Here the points are listed with $s=0$, $t=0$ on the bottom left, with $s$ increasing upwards and $t$ increasing to the right:
